            <h3>Essay</h3>
            <p>In the first poem of Amores Book 3, the speaker recounts an occasion when two feminine figures—Tragedy and Elegy—approached him in the woods and debated his next poetic venture. Would it be a tragedy or a continuation of his elegiac output? The two debaters and the speaker in this literalized depiction of generic rivalry all use diction that betrays what Evangelos Karakasis (2010) terms generic consciousness. Tragedy’s presentation (physical and oral) makes frequent use of terms coded objectionable in the poetics of the 3rd c. BCE Greek poet Callimachus, whose pithy dictum “Big book, big evil” (μέγα βιβλίον, μέγα κακόν, fr. 465 in Pfeiffer, relayed by Athen. 3.72) offers a distilled version of the aversions—and, by way of antonyms, the preferences—associated with this Hellenistic poet. Works that may be deemed large, lengthy, or elevated are “un-Callimachean;” those that are small and slender, brief, or otherwise humble are “Callimachean.” Karakasis presumes an alignment between Callimachean and Ovidian poetics (2010: 13) and argues that Elegy’s victory can be anticipated because of Tragedy’s association in the poem with negative Callimachean ideals (e.g, ingens 11, gravis 35) and Elegy’s association with positive ones (e.g., tenuis 9, leuis 41).

              What Karakasis does not highlight is that the verses on the page function as a spoiler of the result of the debate before it has even begun, much like the elegiac couplets in Amores 1.1, Ovid’s first poem in the three-book collection, reveal that whatever is in front of readers, it is surely not the epic that the speaker claims he was intending to write before Cupid intervened and stole a foot away from a hexameter. At the beginning of her speech in Amores 3.1, Elegy even draws attention to her “home court advantage,” stating to Tragedy, who has just finished making her case, “You’ve battled me using my own verses” (in me pugnasti uersibus usa meis, 41). It is difficult to envision a similar generic debate occupying the first 70 verses of a tragedy, and for this reason we might interpret the generic self-consciousness of Amores 3.1 as a feature of Ovidian elegy itself; the genre, especially as deployed by Ovid, entails discussions of genre. 
              
              If we envision the generic hierarchy to which ancient Greco-Roman authors conventionally subscribed as a ladder that writers aspire to ascend (or claim they aspire to ascend), light amatory verse will appear on a lower rung than tragedy, and the work on the highest rung will likely be a “big book”— a Homeric epic or Vergil’s Aeneid. The Ovidian speaker’s discussions of genre and meter elsewhere in the Amores set elegy against epic in terms that generally observe this hierarchy. In Amores 1.1 the speaker claims that his efforts to compose an epic were stymied by Cupid’s metrical meddling; his weighty, more serious work (1.1.1) had to be abandoned. In Amores 2.1, too, the speaker claims he was writing a gigantomachy—a narrative of the battle between the Olympians and the giants that would presumably be composed as an epic. In his description, he grants this work the generic “high ground” through the language of spatial elevation: his epic is about caelestia … bella, or “celestial wars.” 
              
              Here in Amores 3.1, the speaker encounters a different generic foil in Tragedy, yet her higher status also is conveyed through her physicality: she has a long gait (ingenti … passu, 11) and her footwear emphasizes height (alta pedum uincla, 14). When at the conclusion of her speech, poised atop her tragic boots, she tosses her hair (31-2), she can be imagined towering over the speaker. The content of her speech also frames the hierarchy of genres in varied dimensions: tragic poetry is weightier (grauiore, 23) and a “greater work” (maius opus, 24) while elegy is the stuff of juvenile play (lusit tua Musa, 27 and iuuenta, 28). In the sequence of the speeches, her words appear before and, in a physical sense, above those of Elegy, a point to which we’ll return at the conclusion of this essay when we consider how the poem engages with notions of textual materiality.
              Add some philosophical citations midway like Fulkerson?
              
              Elegy begins her speech by affirming the generic hierarchy Tragedy sets forth. According to Elegy, Tragedy’s words are themselves heavy (grauibus and grauis in 35-6), and Tragedy had to condescend (es…dignata, 37) to speak in elegiac couplets. While Tragedy’s songs are sublimia (39), Elegy herself claims to be leuis (41). Yet Elegy asserts power through her generic nature, too. In a surprising couplet early in her speech (43-4), she claims responsibility for “culturing” Venus, the goddess of love. As if in response to Tragedy’s gibe that the speaker is an object of mockery at parties and crossroads all over town (17-22), Elegy suggests that, without her services, Venus would still be more suited to the country (rustica, 43). In short, she has made love more urbane. Moreover, by serving as the goddess’s lena, or “procuress,” a role that elsewhere in Ovid’s Amores (e.g., 1.8) is associated with making the speaker’s love interest less accessible and, paradoxically, more desirable, she exercises control over urbane amatory interactions. A tragedy cannot persuade a hesitant love interest to unbolt her door, but Elegy’s flatteries can do this and more. After all, Corinna, the speaker’s love interest, has already learned some tricks from Elegy that amorous encounters, however illicit (49-52).
              
              Elegy hints that her humble status, her generic lightness (leuis), gives her an advantage over Tragedy: she has endured things that Tragedy’s pride would never countenance. As she lists the potentially humiliating ways in which she has served the speaker, Elegy also shifts to addressing the speaker, thus underscoring another genre-specific attribute: love elegy is personal. There is not only the relationship between the speaker and his love interest but also the relationship between the speaker and Elegy/elegy herself/itself. And as Elegy emphasizes in the final verse of her speech, this final relationship has a history.
              
              The temptation to read the debate onto what is known of Ovid’s other writings is hard to resist. According to the 1st c. CE Roman rhetorician Quintilian, Ovid composed a tragedy about Medea (Inst. 10.97), only two fragments of which survive to the present.  Quintilian nonetheless held it in high esteem, opining that the tragedy offers evidence of what Ovid could have accomplished “had he preferred to command (imperare) rather than indulge (indulgere) his talent.” (Quintilian’s word choice maps nicely onto the debate in Amores 3.1: Tragedy is the imperious one, while Elegy is the tender one with a history of granting the speaker favors.) At what point in his career Ovid composed his Medea is impossible to know,  but an autobiographical reading of Amores 3.1 invites readers to imagine that Ovid composes the poem to dramatize his feeling of being pulled in two directions at once. 
              
              Autobiographical or not, Amores 3 presents a speaker who appears to be working on two projects simultaneously. After Tragedy and Elegy have both made their cases, the speaker addresses Tragedy first and suggests he is already channeling her power (iam nunc contacto magnus in ore sonus, 64). Elegy’s gift to the speaker is likewise acknowledged in the present tense (das, 65; cf. decoras, 63). Both works are, in a sense, in progress, and the Ovidian speaker is not deliberating which one to begin but which one to finish. Will it be the demanding, thrilling tragedy or the tried-and-true elegy? 
              
              Only in verse 66, five lines before the poem’s conclusion, does the speaker command Elegy to proceed…for now. Elegy’s victory comes with an expiration date, and the speaker informs Tragedy in the final couplets that his turn to her genre is imminent. Reading across the collection, he seems to make good on his promise. In the final poem of the book in Amores 3.15, the speaker announces his retirement from writing elegy and, in the next verse, declares “Horned Lyaeus has rattled with his weightier thyrsus” (corniger increpuit thyrso grauiore Lyaeus, 3.15.17). Bacchus, referenced here using the cult title “Lyaeus,”  is described as wielding the thyrso grauiore that Tragedy calls for in Amores 3.1.23. The echo of the opening debate persists also in the tense of verb used: increpuit implies that the Bacchic inspiration has already been felt. The speaker is resuming his other work in progress.
              
              Yet to expand upon a point offered in the second paragraph above, the answer to the question embedded in Amores 3.1 (“Shall I, the speaker, continue with a tragedy or with additional elegy?”) is delivered before the question is even articulated. The second verse appears before readers’ eyes as an elegiac pentameter, as if the numen sensed in the woods mentioned in verse 2 is the figure of Elegia (who, appropriately enough, appears first to the speaker). And when the terms of the debate are eventually set, the conclusion remains self-evident. After all, whether the reader of Amores 3.1 is encountering the text as a papyrus roll or a codex, it is apparent to the reader that the elegiac book continues. There is more scroll to unfurl, additional pages to turn.
              
              If the reader does not immediately consider how the physical text on the page forecasts the speaker’s decision (or, alternatively, if readers interpret the story recounted in the poem as independent from the poem itself), a sequence of verses in Elegy’s speech invite readers to consider the materiality of the book. When Elegy reminds the poet of her past service (53-58) in making her case, the poetry, the genre, is presented as inseparable from its physical forms (here I propose wax tablets, although some critics read this as papyrus). Elegy casts herself as typically personal and private; that she was “unafraid to be read by the passing populace” (e.g., non uerita a populo praetereunte legi, 54) is evidence of her willingness to endure embarrassment. She seems more familiar with an individual—personal—readership, and for that reason she waited out the departure of her mistress’s guardian and tolerated being concealed in a go-between’s garments. In short, Elegy speaks as if she usually has an audience of one; she is sent as a birthday gift for a single person, even if the barbarous birthday girl doesn’t show particular gratitude.
                
              For her part, Tragedy eschews references to poetic materiality. She casts her genre as an orally performed one, invoking the language of song and breath (cane, 25 and spiritus, 30) as opposed to Elegy’s sensitivity to readership (legi, 54). We can compare a similar juxtaposition of genres from the beginning of Amores Book 2, when the speaker begins by identifying the unideal audience for his elegies. The speaker warns off stern women in 2.1.4, telling them, “You all are unsuitable audiences for tender rhythms.” The word I translate as “audiences” is theatra, and its resonance with the stage genre will be immediately apparent. The speaker wants nothing to do with a theater—with large bodies of viewers. In the remainder of the passage in 2.1, he envisions his ideal readership (2.1.5-10):
              
              Let her read (legat) me—the ready maiden in front of her fiancé,
                   and the inexperienced boy touched by an unknown love.
              And may some youth, from the bow by which I am now wounded,
                   recognize the shared tokens of his own ardor,
              and after he’s marveled awhile, may he say, “Informed by what spy
                   has that poet composed by misfortunes?”
              
              The members of his readership (legat) are individualized: the girl before her lover and the love-sick youth.
              
              Returning to Amores 3.1, as we note the ways that the materiality of the text, including the material circumstances in which a text is read, vary between tragedy and elegy, we can hazard some modern comparanda. Large format hardcover reference books are consulted in libraries. Softcover Harlequin romances are read in the privacy of one’s own home or discreetly on public transportation. And while tragedies may be read at home or in a literature class, they’re best experienced in performance—in the theater itself in front of an audience. As for love notes and poems, those should be read behind closed doors. 
              But the reading contexts for the elegiac poetry in Amores 3.1 are not consistent. The figure of Tragedy teases near the beginning of her speech that the speaker’s elegies have reached an audience besides his beloved, one familiar with boozy parties and street corners; the poet doesn’t seem to know he’s a figure of fun in the whole city. We learn from Elegy that the speaker’s texts may have gotten away from him through his own indiscretion. When he affixed his elegies to doors, he opened them up to public consumption—to be read by the random passerby. Thus, even as the figure of Elegy intimates that the proper space for elegy and its readers is a private one, we must remind ourselves that we, too, are readers of the speaker’s elegies. In what physical forms are we reading them? And where?
              
              These questions recall others articulated and alluded to throughout the preceding essay. Should we be thinking of Amores 3.1 as proceeding simultaneously with the debate? Can the poem’s form and content be separated? No easy answers present themselves. For one, our poet-speaker is squirrely with verb tense. The first five verses contain exclusively present-tense verbs (stat, est, queruntur, spatior) such that the reader is granted an initial feeling of accompanying the speaker in his wooded wanderings. Yet the clause containing the last of these present-tense verbs (dum … spatior, 5) is retroactively reframed in the past when, in verse 6, the speaker uses the imperfect quaerebam as the main verb (see the grammatical note on v. 6). From that point on, the debate between Tragedy and Elegy is recounted exclusively with imperfect- and perfect-tense verbs, and so too is the speaker’s response to both women/genres. Then, however, in the final verse and a half, present-tense verbs resume (properentur, uacat, urguet). If the speaker’s encounter with the genres occurred in the past, the effects of it are unfolding in the here and now. 
              
              The temporal disorientation lends the poem a dreamlike quality. (Has the speaker unwittingly tumbled down a rabbit hole in his stroll through the woods?) Beyond the patently surreal appearance of literary genres as walking, speaking women, one further dreamlike element warrants attention: how the figure of Elegy disrupts the speaker’s ability to recall details. When he describes her appearance in verse 8, he seems unsure of whether one foot was in fact longer than the other (puto). In describing her again before her response to Tragedy, he cannot remember with confidence if she smiled before speaking (si memini, 33) or if she was in fact carrying a myrtle branch (fallor, 34). Yet to assert that the speaker was merely having trouble recalling details of a dreamed encounter with Elegy (and Tragedy) would rob Amores 3.1 of its magic. On the contrary, a sense of magic—perhaps even divine magic—is precisely what this language of vague recollection lends the poem. Elegy is dazzling the speaker, even flirting with him as she reminds him of her charms and favors.
              
              And she succeeds. By the end of Amores 3.1, the speaker renews a (temporary) vow to his first genre. We may thus retrospectively regard the poem as an account of his falling back in love with elegy/Elegy, and in rereading the poem, we may detect a verbal echo of the speaker’s first love. In verse 7, just after the speaker explains that he was pondering what to write, Elegy arrived in the poem so suddenly that the verb indicating her arrival appears before her name does (uenit…Elegia). Venīre is also used in the present tense to narrate the abrupt first appearance of the Ovidian speaker’s love interest Corinna in Amores 1.5, a poem in which a midday sexual liaison unfolds as if in a daydream. After the speaker of Amores 1.5 establishes the setting (he was resting on a bed on a hot day, windows partially closed and dappled light shining in), “Behold, Corinna comes” (ecce, Corinna uenit…).  T.D. Papanghelis (1989) observes how Corinna’s appearance resembles divine epiphanies in Greek literature, not only through her noontime appearance but also in her impact on the poetic project: she “inaugurates” the speaker’s Amores (58). The named “girlfriend” is a necessary inspiration for Roman love elegists. Catullus wrote of Lesbia, Propertius of Cynthia, Tibullus of Delia and Nemesis, and in the fifth poem of Book 1 of the Amores, the Ovidian speaker’s puella is given a name—a name that may have also been attributed to the poet’s books (Cf. the grammatical notes on Delia and Nemesis in 3.9.31 and Corinna in 3.12.16).
