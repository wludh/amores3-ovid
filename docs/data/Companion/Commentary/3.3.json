  "7": "The different verb tenses (erat / est) again emphasize the endurance of the status quo.\nReferences to feet in Ovid often carry metapoetic force, as in Amores 3.1.7-10. Other vocabulary and features of this couplet also seem to echo the initial description of Elegeia in Amores 3.1, such as the terms forma and decens and the superlative artissima (vs. tenuissima, 3.1.9).",

A&G 382.1) in which the dative of an abstract noun (here inuidia) indicates what something accomplishes (commonly known as a âpredicative dativeâ) and for whom (i.e., a dative of reference). I generally suggest translating the abstract noun with âa source of.â\nThe speaker draws a mythological comparison highlighting the unfairness of punishing one individual for anotherâs fault. Andromeda, the daughter of Cepheus (i.e., âthe Cepheian maidenâ), was sentenced to death because of her motherâs boastful claim to be more beautiful than the Nereids. With his rhetorical question, the speaker suggests this should be a source of shame for the gods.\nCephÄÃ¯a is four syllables.",
  "18": "The word order seems to mirror the complicated ethics of Andromedaâs punishment. Scansion shows formosa to be ablative, thus modifying parente. iussa is nominative, modifies virgo (17), and takes a complementary infinitive. male looms over the entire verse but can be comfortably read with iussa or mori.\nY: A second hand in darker ink seems to have struck out the n in formonsa, also placing a dot below it. Is this an early occasion of orthographic normalizing. (The same word in 3.7.1 does not show any markings.)",

Translate as âthe fact that.â\nuos habui: âI have regarded youâ (OLD habeo 24).\ntestÄ«s: an accusative plural in apposition with uos\nMight sine pondere testis introduce an accusation punning on âlightweightâ witnesses and insufficiently masculine gods?

Semele asks that Jupiter promise to do whatever she asks, prompting him to swear that heâll do just that. She asks that he appear in his divine glory for their next sexual liaison, and her death is inevitable. Unable to endure the omnipotent presence of Jupiter, Semele miserabilis arsit.
