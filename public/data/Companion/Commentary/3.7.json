  "84": "dedecus hoc = “this dishonor” implied in her status as “untouched.” The speaker plays with the irony that, on this occasion, her purity is a source of disappointment and dishonor.\nThe puella is the subject of dissimulauit.\nEssay:\nTaken on its own, Amores 3.7 can be placed very near the beginning of a tradition of “impotency poems,” serving as the primary model for the Earl of Rochester’s “Imperfect Enjoyment” of 1684 (Lavery 2014). The Latin poets who wrote on the topic before Ovid, several of whose references to erectile dysfunction are made obliquely or only in passing, include Catullus (c. 3, 11), Horace (Epodes 8 and 12), Propertius (2.15.7-8), and Tibullus (1.5.39-42), with Horace’s Epodes offering the most explicit treatment of erectile dysfunction until Ovid’s own. But while both of Horace’s poems feature speakers using an iambic register and coarse language, Ovid’s poem hews closely to the euphemistic tone of love elegy.\nThe speaker of 3.7 names one of his recent lovers as “Corinna” (25), thus encouraging our identification of him with the speaker elsewhere in the collection. But the woman in 3.7 whom he refers to as the puella—his “girl” or “girlfriend”—does not appear to be Corinna. Ovid’s willingness to play with the convention of the elegist’s fidelity to a single woman at any given time (e.g., “Cynthia” throughout the poetic books of Propertius, “Delia” and “Nemesis” in the books of Tibullus) will already be familiar to readers of Amores 2.7 and 2.8 in which poems the speaker puts his shamelessness and faithlessness on equal display; to Corinna (in 2.7) he stridently disputes a charge of having cheated only to ask (in 2.8) Cypassis, the enslaved woman with whom he cheated, how Corinna learned of their affair. That the speaker of 3.7 was sleeping, or attempting to sleep, with someone other than Corinna is not apparently problematic here, especially since he confesses to having had sex recently with three other women (vv. 23-24).\nSuch casual and unselfconscious acknowledgement of infidelity may, when situated amid the rest of the poems in Book 3, betray some greater instability in their relationship and, by extension, the amatory program that the speaker of Amores has outlined. Here, in the midst of a poetry book in which the speaker has already announced his intention of leaving the elegiac genre behind (Amores 3.1), the speaker’s physical inability to attain sexual satisfaction due to his own shortcomings may presage a poetic inability to continue his pursuit of love elegy (Cf. Keith 1999: 60 and De Caro 2003: 105).\nThe narrative content of the poem is relatively straightforward: the speaker recounts a recent occasion of erectile dysfunction. He oscillates between blaming his sexual partner, wondering if he has been cursed, dwelling on his own shame, praising the woman, and reproaching his penis. In a sudden shift to the present tense near the end of the poem (v. 67), he acknowledges that “now” (i.e., at the time of his narration) his penis is again making promises that he doesn’t believe it can keep. When he resumes his narrative of the moment of impotence, implicitly contrasting his readiness “now” with the woman’s unsuccessful efforts to arouse him “then” with manual stimulation, he relates how she accused him of being either cursed or exhausted from a previous sexual encounter. She then leapt out of bad, he recounts in the final two couplets, and bathed herself in such a way that her maids wouldn’t know about the unfulfilling encounter.\nOne irony of this final detail, of course, is that the speaker is broadcasting the episode—an interaction that he admits brought him no small degree of shame (v. 37)—to anyone who encounters the poem. Even if the woman’s bathing leads her attendants to conclude, however erroneously, that she and the speaker had sex, any audience to 3.7 knows better. Then again, who within the fiction of the poem would that audience be? The speaker neither identifies himself as a poet nor projects any self-consciousness that his present narrative is a poem. We can contrast, for example, the seemingly unified poet-speaker of Amores 3.1.67 and 3.15.1 who presents himself as a “bard” (uatis) addressing himself to literary genres. In 3.7 the speaker’s only explicit addressee within the poem is his uncooperative penis (v. 71).\nOne might wish, therefore, to interpret the poem as a soliloquy in which the speaker rehashes the encounter in his own mind and fixates on what happened, what didn’t happen, and why. This has the added benefit of accounting for the speaker’s tendency toward repetition. He repeats twice in the opening 15 verses how he lay there (iacui in vv. 4 and 15) limply; he reiterates at verses 20, 43, and 60 that the woman didn’t experience him as a man (uir); he bemoans in verses 22 and 53 the fact that the woman was able to rise from the bed (surgit) in such a state of sexual cleanliness that she could participate in religious rituals; he uses the same verb to describe her solicitous efforts to arouse him (sollicitare in v. 56 and v. 74); and he has the woman herself echo in verses 79-80 the worry he articulates in verses 27-36 that his erectile dysfunction may have been caused by witchcraft. Reading between the (repeated) lines, the speaker has gotten in his own head.\nAlison Sharrock (1995) reads a poetic resonance in the repetition, too: “It is a poem which goes round in circles, always promising climax but never achieving it” (152). She finds in this unsatisfying circle an analogy to elegy itself wherein any sustained sexual and emotional satisfaction of the poet-lover must coincide with an end to the circumstances (namely, a persistent absence of sexual and emotional satisfaction) that motivate the poetry. She asserts that the poem is about poetic impotence—or “writer’s block”—along with sexual impotence and that sexual impotence is “the ultimate exclusion” (162) for a genre so often structured around episodes of rejection, such as the exclusus amator (“excluded lover”) of the paraclausithyron. She also teases out another irony: the speaker, while chronicling his sexual impotence, ultimately flaunts his elegiac potency in a poem of considerable length (175).\nNiklas Holzberg (2009) detects another type of poetic play in the repetition, this one in the form of a generic tease. The speaker walks the line between elegy, where euphemism for sexual acts is de rigueur, and epigram/iambics, “where obscenities and the type of diction they engender were used to titillate readers” (937).\nAs noted above, 3.7’s narrative content does not draw attention to its status as a poem nor to its speaker’s status as a poet. Sharrock regards the passage beginning with verse 67, marked as it is by the temporal adverb nunc (“now”) and a series of present-tense verbs, as the “moment of poetic action” (157), but these verses fail to deploy vocabulary referring to poetic composition.  This lack of poetic self-consciousness corresponds with fewer opportunities for readers to observe book materiality beyond their own physical encounter with the poem, be it visual or aural. For example, a silent reader of 3.7 might observe the line indentations associated with elegiac couplets, and a reciter or audience to recitation would have ample opportunity to detect the poetic rhythms of the verse. The poem’s location near—but not at—the middle of the poetic book does not seem significant, although if 3.5 is interpolated (see the discussion in the “Introduction to 3.5”), 3.7 would be renumbered 3.6 and, as a result, open the second third (i.e., poems 6-10) of the 15-poem collection.\nSharrock’s (1995) article about 3.7, summarized above, highlights the elegiac prowess and potency on display in the poem, but we can conclude by considering some further implications of the analogy she draws between impotency and “writer’s block.” Most of the forms of exclusion experienced and lamented by elegiac speakers, be they rivals, doors, distance, or even a woman’s disinterest, are ostensibly external to the speaker and therefore obstacles that the speaker can labor to overcome through his poetry. But “writer’s block” and erectile dysfunction locate the obstacles within the poetic mind and the male body, respectively, and thus pose an existential threat to the broader elegiac economy.  The fact that this threat appears in a collection that has already been announced as the poetic speaker’s valedictory to the genre (Amores 3.1) could indicate a more comprehensive breakdown in the elegist’s multibook program or, more narrowly, a realization of “the final book’s program of disengagement from elegy.”  When readers of Amores 3.7 unroll the scroll, turn the page, or otherwise advance to Amores 3.8, they are addressed by a self-consciously poetic speaker, “I, that pure priest of the Muses and Apollo” (ille ego Musarum purus Phoebique sacerdos, v. 23), eager to review the limits to poetry’s power when it is set against wealth. And unlike erectile dysfunction, this monetary shortcoming is not the problem of one speaker but the entire class of elegiac poets.\nAdditional notes\nrepetition in the poem: could be fixation or repetition in (failed) sexual play\nsex and gender\npublic private discourse\nnoteworthy that Ovid attempts to articulate female disappointment and shame\n“eroticism of euphemism” = 3.7 avoids taboo words but deals directly with a taboo subject\nelegy = programmatically impotent (159)\nnotes poetic language tthat indicates sexual activity\n3.6 = novel paraclausithyron\n3.6, 7 and 8 all highlight the failure of poetry, but elegy has failure baked into it.\n3.1.33 Elegy’s eyes “may remind us of Cynthia at the beginning of the Propertian monobiblos.”\nSharrock (1995) 166: “A self-contradictory power-in-powerlessness is the structuring principle of seruitium amoris, another classically elegiac conceit. The poet, active lover that he is, plays the role of the subordinate under the control of his domina, emasculated by her domination of his emotions and life. But really he is in control. Perhaps…”\nKeith 1999: 61 “In 3.7, Ovid presses to its limits the metaphor that figures the elegiac text as the sexually dynamic or dysfunctional body of the elegiac speaker.\npuella = poeta with her use of blanditiae (11 and 58) Cf. 2.1.21 and 3.1.46\n“gender roles and the power and activity they imply are inverted” 167\nEcl. 9 as locus classicus of poetic memory #literarylaughter Cf. Alpers 142f\nKeith Engendering Rome 2000 p. 115: “circulation of propertius’s Cynthia/text “literalizes the trope that figures the publication of elegiac poetry as his mistress’ sexual circulation among men.”\nWith its vivid description of an (intended) intimate encounter, the poem recalls elements of the episode narrated in Amores 1.5. The woman’s speech at the conclusion recalls Propertius 1.3.\nEllis 1912: 4 refers to Ovid’s Amores as “the finest of his works” and “by far the finest effort of Ovid’s genius.”\nThe Amores of Ovid A Lectured Delivered in the Hall of Corpus Christi College on Tuesday, June 11, 1912 by Robinson Ellis"
